# Repository Group for Github

Browser extension (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Firefox) that organizes an organization's repositories into nested groups, shared through `repo-groups.yml` in `<org>/.github`. No server. Spec: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # Chromium (npm run dev:firefox for Firefox)
npm test
npm run build && npm run size
```

## Create the GitHub App

Generate a registration link with the permissions preselected:

```bash
node scripts/app-link.mjs            # personal account
node scripts/app-link.mjs <org>      # organization
```

Open it, then on the form:

1. Check **Enable Device Flow**.
2. Uncheck **Expire user authorization tokens** (checked by default).
3. Under *Where can this GitHub App be installed?* select **Any account** (the link cannot set it; the default is "Only on this account", which blocks installing on an org).
4. Expand *Repository* and *Organization* permissions and confirm the levels below.
5. Click **Create GitHub App**. Do not generate a client secret or private key.
6. Set the Client ID and slug in `src/config.ts`.
7. **Install App** on each account or org with **All repositories**.

Permissions: Metadata (read), Contents (read & write), Issues (read), Pull requests (read), Administration (read & write), Organization Members (read). Details in [docs/github-app.md](docs/github-app.md).

## Status

Milestones 1–6 done: scaffold, tested `core/`, background worker (device flow, token fallback, parallel repo index with cache, `repo-groups.yml` reader, access detection), and the read-only grouped view on `github.com/orgs/<org>/repositories` (groups and subgroups, sidebar tree, group pages at `#infra/dagu`, search, GitHub-list toggle), plus Edit group / New group. Org owners and members with write access to `<org>/.github` can edit groups and create groups and subgroups from the page (each save is a commit to `repo-groups.yml`). The YAML editor (Edit YAML) has the AI round-trip: copy the prompt with the file and repositories, paste the answer back, review the diff, commit. Groups have a display name (any characters) and a slug (`grupo-competicao`). Next: logos, new-repository field, teams (in progress).

The page selectors in `src/github/selectors.ts` were written from the screenshots in `design/screenshots`, not from live GitHub. If the grouped view does not appear, check them first (the extension logs `[RG] could not find the repositories list…` in the page console and leaves the page alone).

`npm run size` only reports the budgets from CLAUDE.md §10; add `--strict` to fail on them.
